# gan_faces
GAN Faces is a project aimed at generating realistic human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously. The generator learns to create images that are indistinguishable from real images, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between real and generated images.

This project focuses on utilizing GANs to generate high-quality facial images, exploring various architectures, training techniques, and dataset preprocessing methods to achieve lifelike results.
